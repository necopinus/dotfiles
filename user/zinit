# Additional Zsh configuration either needs to be called in ~/.zshenv
# (for non-login shells) or ~/.zprofile (for login shells). The reason
# we need to do this in two different ways is that when ZSH is a login
# shell it sources /etc/zsh/zprofile, which on Kali sources
# /etc/profile, which resets our PATH (thus wiping out anything we do in
# ~/.zshenv)... But in X11 ~/.zprofile never gets sourced at all (since
# we're already logged in, and X11 has set up our environment).

# Add Radicle Upstream binary directory to the path, if it exists.
