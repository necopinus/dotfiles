# Add elements to the path for ZSH. This either needs to be called in
# ~/.zshenv (for non-login shells) or ~/.zprofile (for login shells).
# The reason we need to do this in two different ways is that when ZSH
# is a login shell, it sources /etc/zsh/zprofile, which on Kali sources
# /etc/profile, which resets our PATH (thus wiping out anything we do in
# ~/.zshenv)... But in X11 ~/.zprofile never gets sourced at all (since
# we're already logged in, and X11 has set up our environment). So we
# need to call this in both places.
