#: Text cursor customization {{{

cursor #bdae93

#: Default text cursor color. If set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. Its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. Note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

cursor_text_color #665c54

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

#: Color scheme {{{

foreground #fbf1c7
background #282828

#: The foreground and background colors.

selection_foreground none
selection_background #504945

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.
